This small bash script somewhat automates the creation of zip files when you want to upload an X:Rebirth mod (although it's hardly custom-tailored for any particular directory structure).

The script expects to be run from a folder in the 'extensions' folder. It takes one argument, which is the name of the extension to be packed.
